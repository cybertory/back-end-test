## Context

Build a RESTful API that can `create/read/update/delete` user data from a persistence store.


### User Model

```
{
  "id": "xxx",                  // user ID (must be unique)
  "fullname": "backend test",       // user name
  "birthday": "",                    // date of birth
  "address": "",                // user address
  "description": "",            // user description
  "createdAt": ""               // user created date
  "updatedAt": ""               // user updated date
}
```


### Functionality

- The API should follow typical RESTful API design pattern.
- The data should be saved in the DB.
- Provide proper API documentation.
- Proper error handling should be used.


### Basic Requirements

  - Use Node.js `LTS` and any framework of your choice.
  - Use any persistence store. NoSQL DB is preferred.
  - Write concise and clear commit messages.
  - Write clear **documentation** on how it has been designed and how to run the code.
